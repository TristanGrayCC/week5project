# Fantasy Beasts Project

## Project Brief

My first coding project after 5 weeks at CodeClan Scotland. Brief was to build a functional and interactive full-stack web app using Ruby and SQl.

## Description

This is a PostgreSQL back-end, Ruby logic and  HTML/CSS front-end backed by sinatra full stack project. Focus was on implementing our first independent full stack application.

To make things interesting the application holds a few surprises for users. For example, should a rider choose to adopt a fantasy steed that can't handle - They will be eaten by the steed, killed and their adopted steeds returned to the adoption pool.

### Built using
Ruby 2.3.1 with sinatra, sinatra config and pg gems
